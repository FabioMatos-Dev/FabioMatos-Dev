This is Fabio de Matos here.
I'm a Junior Developer currently based in Curitiba/PR, Brazil, but planning moving to Canada.
I'm enrolled in a 3 years Analysis and Systems Development course at Federal Institute of Parana.
Aiming into a Full Stack Developer career, but for now focused on acquiring Front-End developer skills.
